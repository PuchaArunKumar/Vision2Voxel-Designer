    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Prompt Understanding**\n",
    "- Utilize NLP models such as **BERT** or **RoBERTa** to process and understand the user's input prompt.  \n",
    "- Example: For the prompt _\"Design a car for a person with one leg\"_, the NLP model extracts key information to guide the generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Generative AI for Visualization**\n",
    "- The processed input is passed to a **Generative AI model** (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL·E) to create a visual output tailored to the user's requirements.  \n",
    "- The AI model takes into account specific design requirements, accessibility needs, and aesthetic preferences.\n",

    "3. **Preparing for 3D Printing:**  \n",
