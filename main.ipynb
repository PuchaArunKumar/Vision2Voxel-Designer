    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Prompt Understanding**\n",
    "- Utilize NLP models such as **BERT** or **RoBERTa** to process and understand the user's input prompt.  \n",

    "#### 2. **Generative AI for Visualization**\n",
    "- The processed input is passed to a **Generative AI model** (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALLÂ·E) to create a visual output tailored to the user's requirements.  \n",

    "3. **Preparing for 3D Printing:**  \n",
    "   - Validate the mesh structure to ensure it is error-free and 3D-print ready.  \n",
